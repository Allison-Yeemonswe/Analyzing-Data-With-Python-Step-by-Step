Our Scenario

Let's say we have a friend named Tom.
And Tom wants to sell his car.
But the problem is he doesn't know how much he should sell his car for.
Tom wants to sell his car for as much as he can.
But he also wants to set the price resonably, so someone would want to purchase it.
So the price he sets should represent the value of the car.
How can we help Tom determine the best price for his car?
Let's think like data scientists and clearly define some of his problems.
For example, is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics?
Wht features of cars affect their prices? Color? Brand?
Does also horse power effect the selling price or perhaps something else? 
As a data analyst or data scientist, there are some of the questions we can start thinking about.
To answer these questions, we're going to need some data. We'll be going into how to understand the data,
how to import it into python and how to begin looking into some basic insights from the data.
We'll be looking at he dataset on used car prices.
The data is in csv format.
